# The port to listen to for HTTP requests
server:
    port: 9000
    host: "::1"

scan:
    # The script that will be given a file as its first parameter
    script: './example.sh'
    # If set and the script exits with an exit code listed here, the failure will not be
    # cached. Useful to prevent caching of a failure due to e.g. the antivirus restarting.
    #
    # doNotCacheExitCodes:
    #   - 1
    #   - 2
    #
    # The temporary directory to use
    tempDirectory: '/tmp'
    # The base URL of the homeserver to download media from
    baseUrl: 'https://matrix.org'
    # If set to true, effectively set baseUrl to
    #   "https://$domain"
    #   where $domain is the domain part of the requested media.
    #
    # This should only be used when it is preferable not to download
    # media through the normal route: via a single (and federated)
    # homeserver.
    #
    # directDownload: false

# Optional. A command to execute when unlinking files from the file
# system instead of using node's fs.unlink. When executed, the first
# argument to the command will be the path of the file being
# removed.
#
# altRemovalCmd: 'rm'

# Optional. If need to use a proxy to access baseUrl
# proxy: "http://10.228.1.1:80"

# Optional. Settings to send HTTP header in download requests from
# content scanner to homeserver
#requestHeader:
    # Optional. If need to send a 'user-agent' header
    # If set to 'origin', uses the user agent used by the client
    # when sending the request to the content scanner
    # userAgent: 'matrix-content-scanner'
    #
    # Optional. If need to send a 'x-forwarded-for' header
    # If set to 'origin', uses the IP address of the client that
    # sent the request to the content scanner
    # xForward: 'x-forwarded-for'

middleware:
    # Configuration for using encrypted_body in POST requests.
    encryptedBody:
        # The following configuration allows for the encrypted_body
        # decryption key to be persisted to the file system. This means
        # the public/private key pair will not change when the AV server
        # is restarted.
        #
        # The pickle key secret used to unpickle the decryption key
        pickleKey: 'some_random_secret'
        # The file that the decryption key will be written to if the file
        # does not exist. If it does exist, the file will be read from and
        # the unpickled key will be used to decrypt encrypted_body
        # requests.
        picklePath: 'av_pickled_decryption.key'

# Optional. A list of accepted MIME types.
# WARNING! It should be noted that this cannot be relied on for security:
# it is possible to specially craft files that look like different kinds of file.
# As one example, it is possible to craft a file which is both a PNG file and a
# ZIP file yet will be detected as `image/png`.
# Further, it should be generally assumed that most file formats have a way to
# encode and attach extraneous data.
#acceptedMimeType:
#    - 'image/jpeg'
#    - 'image/jpg'
#    - 'image/png'
